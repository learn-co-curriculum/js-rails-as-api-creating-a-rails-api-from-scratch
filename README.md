# Creating a Rails API from Scratch

## Learning Goals

- Create an API-Only Rails Build

## Introduction

In the last few lessons, we saw how we can easily adapt the MVC structure of
Rails to render JSON. Rails is flexible enough to be able to respond to
different formats, and is ready to do so out of the box. For the purposes of
building applications in JavaScript and frameworks like React, though, we
specifically need it to act as an API that responds with JSON.

When first building a Rails application, it is possible to flag that the
application should be API-only. In this lesson, we will take a look at what this
means and how it provides us with some useful automatic configurations.

## Using the `--api` Flag

To create an API-only Rails build from scratch, include the `--api` flag after the
name of the Rails application upon creation:

```sh
rails new bird-watcher-api --api
```

By using the `--api` flag, Rails will remove a lot of default features and
middleware, mostly related to the browser, since it won't be needed. Controllers
will inherit from `ActionController::API` rather than `ActionController::Base`
and generators will skip generating views.

One noticeable change - some browser errors will disappear. Normally, when a Rails
server is running, it produces an error message in browser when something goes
wrong while attempting to render. Since there is no way to render views in this
API-only build, if the Rails API fails and we visit it in browser, it will just
show a blank screen.

No changes are required when setting up resources for an API-only Rails build.

## From Beginning to End

We've gone over the pieces of building an API, so to briefly summarize what
we've done in the last few lessons combined with this new knowledge, first we
create the API-only Rails build:

```sh
rails new bird-watcher-api --api
```

Then, navigate into the new Rails application once created. Rather than create
_everything_ by hand this time, we can use a generator to help us out with
resources.

```sh
rails g resource bird name species
rails g resource location latitude longitude
rails g resource sighting bird:references location:references
```

This will create three migrations, three models, and three empty controllers. With
minimal seed data we could then test that everything was working as expected:

```ruby
bird_a = Bird.create(name: "Black-Capped Chickadee", species: "Poecile Atricapillus")
bird_b = Bird.create(name: "Grackle", species: "Quiscalus Quiscula")
bird_c = Bird.create(name: "Common Starling", species: "Sturnus Vulgaris")
bird_d = Bird.create(name: "Mourning Dove", species: "Zenaida Macroura")

location_a = Location.create(latitude: "40.730610", longitude: "-73.935242")
location_b = Location.create(latitude: "30.26715", longitude: "-97.74306")
location_c = Location.create(latitude: "45.512794", longitude: "-122.679565")

sighting_a = Sighting.create(bird: bird_a, location: location_a)
sighting_b = Sighting.create(bird: bird_b, location: location_b)
sighting_c = Sighting.create(bird: bird_c, location: location_c)
```

Then the controller actions we want in the API will need to be added:

```ruby
def index
  sightings = Sighting.all
  render json: sightings, include: [:bird, :location]
end
```

Since the `resource` generator was used, it would be good to be diligent and
clean up `config/routes.rb` once we've decided what endpoints the API should
have.

## A Note While Developing APIs - Dealing with CORS

While working on your own APIs, you'll typically want to have your Rails server
running while also trying out various endpoints using `fetch()`. In order to do
this, though, you will need deal with [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing][CORS], or CORS.

CORS is designed to prevent scripts like `fetch()` from one origin accessing a
resource from a different origin unless that resource specifically states that
it expects to share. So, for instance, if you have run the command `rails
server` with your server running at `http://localhost:3000`, then go to
'www.google.com', open the browser console and attempt to send a `fetch()` to your
server. The browser considers these two different origins, and will _refuse_
your request.

A solution is already provided though. By using the `--api` flag, the `Gemfile`
was altered to include the [`rack-cors`][rack-cors] gem. The gem will be commented out initially:

```ruby
# Use Rack CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible
# gem 'rack-cors'
```

To get `rack-cors` working, uncomment the gem and run `bundle install`. Then, add the following to
`config/application.rb` **inside** `class Application < Rails::Application`:

```ruby
 config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
      allow do
        origins '*'
        resource '*',
          :headers => :any,
          :methods => [:get, :post, :delete, :put, :patch, :options, :head],
          :max_age => 0
      end
    end
```

This shouldn't replace anything else inside `class Application < Rails::Application`,
just be included in addition.

This will allow you to test your APIs while developing them locally. Secretly,
`rack-cors` has been bundled with the last set of lessons to ensure they were
all working smoothly in case you decided to code along and spin up a rudimentary
API.

**WARNING:** Disabling CORS altogether in the long term can leave your server
unsecure. Check out the documentation on [CORS] and [`rack-cors`][rack-cors] for
additional information.

## Conclusion

With CORS enabled and your resources configured, you should be able to now
run `rails server`, start up your API and begin sending requests to it. 

You have all that you need to get your own API-only Rails builds into
development. If you can think of something that can be turned into an API, you
now have the power to spin one up in short order.

With the ability to create APIs, we will take a closer look at shaping them.
